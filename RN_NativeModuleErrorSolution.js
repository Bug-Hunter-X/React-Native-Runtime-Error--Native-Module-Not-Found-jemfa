The solution depends on the specific native module causing the error.  Generally, this involves verifying the following:

1. **Correct Installation:** Ensure the native module is installed correctly using npm or yarn.  Refer to the library's installation instructions.
2. **Linking:** If required, link the native module to your project.  Use React Native's linking tools (although newer versions often handle this automatically) or follow any platform-specific instructions (Android's `android/app/build.gradle` or iOS's Xcode project configuration).
3. **Build System:** Make sure your Android and/or iOS build systems are properly configured and that all necessary dependencies are included.  Clean and rebuild the project.
4. **Permissions (Android):**  Verify that any necessary Android permissions are declared in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file.
5. **Native Code Compilation:** If you are using a custom native module, double check that you compiled the native code successfully and integrated it into your React Native project.
6. **Library Version Compatibility:** Check for compatibility issues between the native module and your React Native version. Using incompatible versions often leads to these runtime errors.

**Example Fix (Conceptual):**

Instead of directly attempting to use the native module before verifying its integration:

```javascript
// RN_NativeModuleErrorSolution.js
import { NativeModules } from 'react-native';

const { MyNativeModule } = NativeModules;

export const useNativeModule = () => {
  if (MyNativeModule) {
    // Safely use MyNativeModule
    return MyNativeModule.someMethod();
  } else {
    console.error('Native module not found. Verify installation and linking.');
    return null; // Or some alternative behavior
  }
};
```
This example adds a check to see if the native module is available before using it, providing a more graceful fallback.
