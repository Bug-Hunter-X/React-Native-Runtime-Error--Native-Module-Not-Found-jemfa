This error occurs when using a third-party library or native module that's not properly linked or configured within your React Native project.  It often manifests as a runtime error, not a compile-time one, and can be hard to track down because the root cause lies outside your immediate code.  For example, you might be using a library that depends on specific native iOS or Android libraries that aren't correctly installed or linked, resulting in this error at runtime.
