# React Native Runtime Error: Native Module Not Found

This repository demonstrates a common React Native runtime error caused by an issue with a native module.  The example uses a hypothetical native module, but the principles apply to any third-party library or custom native module integration.

## Problem:

The application crashes with a runtime error indicating that a required native module cannot be found. This commonly happens when the native module isn't properly linked or installed within your app's iOS or Android project.

## Solution:

The solution involves verifying the native module's installation and linking steps, which often vary depending on the library. This includes ensuring the native code is correctly built and linked to your React Native app using tools like React Native CLI's `link` command (deprecated in newer versions) or platform-specific build systems. Double-check the library's documentation for precise instructions.

## How to reproduce (Example):

1. Clone this repository.
2. Follow the instructions in `RN_NativeModuleError.js` to set up the error scenario.
3. Observe the runtime error when running the application.
4. Apply the fix provided in `RN_NativeModuleErrorSolution.js` to resolve the issue.
